# Professional Portfolio

## Description 

For this project, I was tasked to create a professional portfolio to highlight personal information, links to various deployed projects, and contact information. I researched portfolio pages and found that experienced designers make them quite involved and impressive.

In this project I learned more about CSS class and ID selectors, as well as how to utilize the grid layout. I also had fun with some interactive features such as alt text and box shadow effects on hover. I finally included a media query to alter the grid layout depending on browser window width to make my page more responsive and accessible to multiple screen sizes.

I deployed the application on [GitHub](https://github.com/) [Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and it can be found [here](https://d-a-v-i-d-w-r-i-g-h-t.github.io/professional-portfolio/).


## Installation

N/A

## Usage 

Screenshot of the web page are provided below showing both the wide and narrow formats.

![Wide format](assets/images/screenshot-wide.png)
![Narrow format](assets/images/screenshot-narrow.png)

Navigation links are at the top right and jump the user to the designated content sections using anchor tags. As the web page isn't very long, this functionality is easier to demonstrate if the user's browser window height is reduced.

The page formatting changes between two columns and one column as shown above when the width is adjusted.

Alternate text and hover glow effects appear when the user hovers over titles or project images, as shown below:

## Credits

I learned about grid layout from [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), [A Complete Guide to CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).

I learned about hover glow from our CSS Code Snippet project.

I used the Horiseon Refactor project to format my unnumbered lists.
